				Hello! My name is Pratibha and I am a freshman at UC Berkeley studying some combination of computer science, data science, statistics, and cognitive science. <br>

				<br>

				At Berkeley, I am a software developer for <a class = "orglink" target="_blank" href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/">CodeBase</a>, an organization that parters with high-growth startups to solve technical challenges.

				<br>
				<br> 
				I also design computer science curriculum and teach at underresourced middle and high schools in the local area as part of <a class = "orglink" target="_blank" href="https://www.berkeleyanova.org">ANova</a>. Education equality is a topic I am extremely passionate about!<br>

				<br>
				

				When I'm not coding, I'm usually dancing with <a class = "orglink" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/natyaatberkeley/">Natya</a>, Berkeley's competitive Indian classical dance team. I also enjoy running, taking naps, and reading thought-provoking books. <br>
